                    <p>A fourth-year student at RMIT University, and aiming to be a DevOps Engineer.</p>
                    <p>I have had a strong interest in IT since I was a kid, and always tried to find ways to expand my
                        knowledge. This would consistently show through my efforts in any given IT class throughout
                        primary and secondary school. Heading into my second year of university, I realised that my end
                        goal would be to work in the Cyber Security industry, as it is one of the biggest growing
                        industries in the area of IT. This eventually changed when I did a DevOps class in 2021, which I
                        thoroughly enjoyed. This when I realised that I would much rather enter the DevOps industry
                        instead, which is one of the biggest IT industries in demand.</p>
                    <p>My experience with University has been amazing, as I have learnt so much over the last 3 and a
                        half years and how you need to put in the work to get to where you want to. Admittedly, I do
                        still struggle with concepts at times, but that's what learning is, full of ups and downs.</p>
                    <p>My present goal is to get a grasp of what it's like to work in the industry, by working in some
                        IT entry-level jobs such as a Data Clerk. If I don't get an entry-level job by the time I
                        graduate from University, I will be planning to do either a graduate program or an internship.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was trying to my place in a world with ever-expanding technologies, but I am confident that I
                        have found it in the DevOps industry. But as I continue to learn and grow, I am confident that I
                        will make it to wherever this journey takes me.</p>

                            <p><a href="https://github.com/louis-manabat/CICD-CircleCI">Repository</a></p>
                            <p id="result">Grade: 77.5/100</p>
                            <p>Objective of assignment:<br>The assignment aims to understand the Continuous
                                Integration/Continuous Deployment (CICD) methodology by
                                focusing on the CI process. This is achieved by using CircleCI to run a CI pipeline to
                                automate the pre-deployment process.</p>
                            <p>What was implemented:<br>Using a pipeline, building and testing are automated to ease
                                manual loading. This will
                                result in quick and easy results, whether it be a pass or fail in the pipeline. Meaning
                                that issues can be pinpointed quicker and be fixed sooner, so changes can be moved to
                                production.</p>

                            <p>What was learnt:<br>I started to gain an understanding of the Continuous Integration
                                process, and how it simplifies testing and deployment of solution via automating it
                                through CircleCI. This helps in a way that it lowers manual workload, and prevents
                                human
                                errors such as forgetting to run a security test for example.</p>

                            <p>Objective of assignment:<br>The assignment aims to fully implement the CICD lifecycle by
                                adding a CD process to the application. This is achieved by deploying an infrastructure
                                via Terraform on AWS, and the solution is deployed onto the EC2 instance by using
                                Ansible. Makefile commands are used here to semi-automate the process, but can be fully
                                automated by implementing a CircleCI pipeline.</p>
